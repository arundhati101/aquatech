 1. **Cost Analysis of Wastewater Treatment for Agricultural Runoff (Indian Context)**
- explored the economic feasibility of wastewater treatment systems for handling agricultural runoff in India.  
- The project involved data collection on treatment costs, efficiency comparisons, and predictive modeling to estimate operational expenses.  
- focus was on optimizing cost-effectiveness while maintaining environmental sustainability.  

 2. **ML-Based Wastewater Quality Prediction Model**  
- This project aimed to predict water quality parameters using machine learning models.  
- You probably used datasets with pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to train regression or classification models.  
- Techniques like Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks might have been applied to improve prediction accuracy.  
- This model could help in real-time monitoring and early detection of contamination in wastewater treatment plants.
